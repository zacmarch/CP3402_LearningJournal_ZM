## Content Insights
* I found bootstrap to be a fast and intuitaive CSS framework. It sped up the process of building a wesbite tremendously for this weeks practical. I plan to utilise the boostrap framework in future projects.
* AWS Amplify was very easy to use and its ability to host from a github repository saves a lot of time. I plan to use this service in future website development projects.  


## Career or Employability insights
I had not known much about Bootstrap prior to attempting this practical and learning how to use it seemed daunting at first. After spending sometime reading and watching videos about Bootstrap I begun to become more familar with how it works and eventually utilized it for completing this week's practical task. I believe the ability to discover and learn new concepts is important for employability and career growth. I plan to seek out and be more open to new concepts in the future to ensure that I have a diverse understanding of my area of work.
