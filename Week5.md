## Content Insights
I found creating child themes to be difficult as some themes did not allow you to modify certain parts of the site by adding additional css. I spent many hours just trying to change the font colour of the website's menu and eventually gave up as I couldn't figure it out. With that aside, I think child themes are a useful concept and I can see the importance of utilizing them in web development.

## Career or Employability insights
In order to modify the files on my hosted WordPress website and complete this practical, I had to research and learn how to use the SFTP client 'WinSCP'. I do not have much experience with this type of software and setting up the connection took a lot of problem-solving skills. I believe problem solving skills are a very important skill to have in the workplace.
