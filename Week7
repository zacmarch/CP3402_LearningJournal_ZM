## Content Insights
At first, coding in PHP seemed daunting but as I familarised with it's syntax and practiced it was actually quite simple to learn. I can attribute this to my previous experience with Java and Python. 

## Career or Employability insights
During this week, the group that I am in had its first meeting which consisted of discussion on
how we were going to start assignment 2. This meeting lacked structure and not much value and direction 
was gained from it. I believe that some sort of meeting plan would greatly improve the outcome of future 
meetings, and I believe this experience is helping to improve my ability to contribute in meetings and understand 
the importance of them.
