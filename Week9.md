## Content Insights
I found that using SASS in web development to be straight-forward to and extremley helpful. I can see how utilizing SASS could speed up website maintenence and development tremendously. I will definitely use SASS in any website development projects in the future.

## Career or Employability insights
I found that the task of installing SASS on my windows system to be confusing and the task took way longer to complete then I expected. I first attempted to use a git bash for windows program so that I could follow along with the setup demonstration in the lecture. I came across many errors that I wasted a couple of hours trying to fix. I eventually gave up and decided to try a different installation method. This new method involved using the windows command prompt and adding the sass package to my systems PATH. This method took less than 10 minutes to complete. I believe this experience was another lesson in time management and a lesson in paying more attention to detail. I should have evaluated and compared each installation method instead of choosing the first one I saw.
